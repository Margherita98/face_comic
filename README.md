# face_comic
I developed a project for Algorithms for Massive Data using Convolutional Neural Networks for faces / comics recognition. 
- In the file "import_data" I take the dataset from Kaggle. 
- In the file "face_or_comics", I do the pre processing with train and test split and then I developed a simple neural network and a convolutional neural network without the model selection.
- In the file "CNN_with_model_selection", I do a convolutional network with model selection using GridSearchCV from scikit-learn.
- The pdf file is the paper for Algorithms for Massive Data Project

At the following link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1UUiQhDKvVftNam1f_vpoZHK3h6M2R3bg#scrollTo=Fkem2e1BC3r0 
you can find all the three files in one in colab.
